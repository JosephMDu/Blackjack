# Blackjack
The classic casino game blackjack coded in Python:

By using the Tkinter library in Python I coded a simple single-hand blackjack game that calls card images within the card
folder to display the delt cards. For each hand, there is a built-in calculator that tells both player and dealer scores and a  randomized deal feature that acts as a shuffle that gives an even chance of pulling each card with the pulled card and then getting removed from the deck like a real deal.
